<!-- 最喜欢的事情是思考。 -->

I would like to describe myself as an "composer": I compose thoughts from words, service from containers, music from notes (but sadly I don’t do well), and life from days.

I maintain serveral images for my self convenience. Now only Caddy Server is in active maintain, but there was and will be more based on my need. I often help my friends deploy service, so they’re always asking for my ssh public key: that’s [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Master-Hash/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/dot_ssh/id_rsa.pub). In spite of this, I hate to manage my own server, so I write and deploy services on Cloudflare Workers as much as possible. I hope to be a packager some day.

I have no long-term goals, but you can find what I’m working on these months at [my Iteration Plan](https://gist.github.com/Master-Hash/0b3e7e329d14129d12b7667bd5a922ee). This’s also a message board, feel free to comment there!

You would also like to read my narrative on [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/hash_elbeszelese). This is a small part of my diary, and more is to be public.
